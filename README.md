# LIME and Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
## Overview
This project explores the use of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to evaluate the performance of a BERT model trained on one domain and applied to another domain. Specifically, it focuses on understanding how transfer learning in NLP (Natural Language Processing) works, and how LIME can provide insights into the model's predictions when applied to cross-domain data.

# Research Question
"How does LIME facilitate the evaluation of a BERT model's transfer learning performance?"

The goal of this project is to apply LIME to a sentiment analysis task, where a model trained on a movie review dataset is tested on a different domain â€” COVID-19-related tweets. By doing so, it investigates how well transfer learning applies across domains and why the model might succeed or fail.


# Credits 
I used the help of Gen AI to train the model and also to help with applying LIME
